# Bangladesh-Bank-Branch-Distribution-Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes the geographical distribution of over **11,000+ bank branches** across Bangladesh. The goal is to identify regional disparities in financial infrastructure and recommend strategic locations for future bank expansion.

Using **Python** and **Data Visualization** techniques, this analysis provides insights into Division, District, and Thana-level banking coverage.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information on:
- **Bank Name & ID**
- **Branch Location** (Division, District, Thana)
- **Branch Code**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `Pandas` (Data Manipulation)
  - `NumPy` (Numerical Operations)
  - `Matplotlib` (Data Visualization)
  - `Seaborn` (Optional, for advanced styling)

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Findings

### 1. Division-wise Distribution
- **Insight:** Dhaka Division dominates the banking sector with the highest number of branches, followed by Chattogram.
- **Visual:** *Bar Chart showing branch counts per division.*

### 2. District-Level Analysis
- **Top Districts:** Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet have the highest concentration of banks.
- **Under-served Districts:** Identified districts with branch counts significantly below the national average.

### 3. Expansion Strategy (Recommendation)
By analyzing the ratio of existing branches vs. division activity, the following districts were identified as **"High Potential Candidates"** for new branches:
- 📍 **Dinajpur**
- 📍 **Narsingdi**
- 📍 **Pabna**
- 📍 **Moulvibazar**
- 📍 **Feni**

> **Business Logic:** These areas show high economic potential but have lower-than-average banking penetration.

### 4. Operational Coverage
- Analyzed how many districts within each division have operational bank branches to measure service accessibility.
